# Crtieria 1: Difficulty/Feasibility
* It has to be feasible that we would complete the project in the alloted time, or the project has to be modular such that we could present without completing everything
* It also can't be too easy where we would be done on the first day

# Criteria 2: Presentability
* It has to be clear to employers that the project is relevant, technically interesting, or useful (this is not an exhaustive list, and I also don't think we need it to be everything)

# Criteria 3: Interest
* I think we will make a better project if we are all engaged with it

# Criteria 4: Usefulness
* Will the project be genuinely useful?



- This is not meant to be an exhaustive list, or even a list of necessary things, but some general guiding principals.
