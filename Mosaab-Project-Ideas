BurpSuite Clone using Python library Scapy:
Scapy is a versatile packet manipulator that can capture, send, decode, and forge packets. It can be used to conduct network-based penetration attacks,
such as man in the middle attacks and spoofing. To do this project, we would need to be familiar with the Scapy interface, advanced python concept class,
and object oriented programming (at a basic level).
