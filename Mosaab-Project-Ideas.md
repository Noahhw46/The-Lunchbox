# BurpSuite Clone using Python library Scapy:

Scapy is a versatile packet manipulator that can capture, send, decode, and forge packets. It can be used to conduct network-based penetration attacks,
such as man in the middle attacks and spoofing. To do this project, we would need to be familiar with the Scapy interface, advanced python concept class,
and object oriented programming (at a basic level).

	- For the project, we would be using Scapy to make a clone code of BurpSuite Pro as a way to get around the oppressive price tag.
	- Features from Burp Suite Pro we would clone into this script:
		-- Building out a proxy
		-- Packet Interceptor and editor 
		-- Decode HTTPS packets
		-- XSRF attacks
